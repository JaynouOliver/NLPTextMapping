## üìå Introduction

This NLP project focuses on text mapping techniques, exploring various methodologies to handle and analyze textual data efficiently. With Jupyter notebooks for proofs of concept and a structured source code setup, it's designed for easy understanding and extensibility.

## üõ† Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip for managing Python packages

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone JaynouOliver/NLPTextMapping
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLPTextMapping
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running Notebooks

To explore the text mapping concepts:

1. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory.
2. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `PoC - Text mapping.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to understand the workflow and outputs.

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üîß Development

This project is structured for easy understanding and further development:

- **Notebooks**: For experimenting with text mapping concepts and visualizing results.
- **src**: Contains the core logic, split into modular components for ease of enhancement and maintenance.

### Key Components:

- `config.py`: Central configuration file.
- `embedding.py`: Handles embedding generation and manipulation.
- `main.py`: The starting point of the application.
- `match.py`: Implements matching logic.
- `pre_process.py`: Prepares data for processing.
- `split_doc.py`: Splits documents for easier handling.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions supporting various tasks.
